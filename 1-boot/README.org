* Day 1 - Boot-CLJ
[[http://boot-clj.com][boot.clj]] is an alternative to the incumbent build system Leiningen. In contrast
to leiningen's purely declarative way, boot feels much more visceral. It
understands that tasks are really dataflows ... and that they should be
observable, and malleable in a REPL, very much the in the mindset of Clojure.
* Thoughts on Design
Composing tasks as middleware (like Ring). This thinking reminds me of working
with Gradle. Boot's /fileset/ is analgous to Gradle's /sourceSet/. And in
Gradle, you can programmatically change the configuration of a task using Groovy
code, in the same way Boot middleware can.
