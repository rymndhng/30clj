* Ephemerals
Ephemeral is a small web utility where you send ephemeral messages to each other
people. Once the email has been opened, it ceases to exist.

This is a small scoped Clojure Project web application project which includes:

- interacting with Postgres
- templating HTML (using Hiccup)
- lazy streams
- building with clj-boot
- using system & component

You can check it out at [[http://www.rymndhng.com/ephemerals/][here]].
