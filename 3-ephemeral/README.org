#+TITLE Ephemeral

Ephemeral is a small web utility where you send ephemeral messages to other
people via E-mail. Once the email has been read, it ceases to exist.

This is a small scoped Clojure Project web application project which includes:

- interacting with Postgres
- templating HTML (using Hiccup)
- lazy streams (by polling a db)

It's mostly self-contained other than the Database.


* Improvements
** TODO Find a clojure library that makes it easy to manage background workers
Managing pools of background workers. It'd be nice to run them on the same JVM
rather than as separate processes.
** TODO Manage environment with environ
