* Batch Writer
An API for pluggable message batching.

Consumer only has to define an instance of the protocol BatchEventPublisher.

A batch will be published when:

1. the cost of the batch exceeds the water mark
2. the background poller times out, in which case all messages are flushed

See example in =core.clj=
